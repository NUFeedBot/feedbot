{"score": 50.0, "tests": [{"output": "", "answer": "The student's code accurately follows the Design Recipe as laid out in the textbook. Naming, structuring and comments are properly structured. The structures for player and match are correctly defined and MatchType as a discrimination set is fine. However, the student did not define an interpreter function for each structure that does pattern matching and is used to guide function design. Otherwise, the student correctly defines both the MatchType and Player data and their constructors, selectors, and mutators. The comments for each struct plainly lay out how each piece of data is represented, and the student correctly uses the abstraction barrier provided by the struct to hide the internal representation of the data from potential users. Overall, a very good job by the student."}]}
